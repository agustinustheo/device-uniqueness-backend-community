## Design goals

**One Rust Cargo workspace of small, independently-deployable services.** Boundaries exist to
isolate secrets, persistence, deployment lifecycle, and failures: a notification, TURN, invite, or
indexing fault must never disrupt login, attestation, or username registration.

Principles that drive every boundary decision:

- **`device-attestation` is the sole JWT issuer.** Siblings are *verify-only* — they validate its
  asymmetric JWT via JWKS **when a route needs auth**, but never mint tokens, never call
  device-attestation synchronously, and never read its tables. *Verify-only does not mean every
  route requires a JWT* — e.g. username search is public.
- **Shared code is minimal and product-agnostic.** No shared database, no shared product logic.
- **Per-service persistence.** Each stateful service owns its data; stateless services add none
  without evidence. No shared tables.
- **One public API behind one path-routing front door.** Every service renders the same JSON error
  envelope (`{error}`, plus `fields` on per-field validation), so a client sees one API rather than
  a federation of them.

## Naming convention

**Plain, boring, descriptive names. No decorative prefixes.**

- A name says what the thing **is/does** in plain English — a new engineer guesses the role in <1s.
- **No workspace prefix** (`id-`, `shared-`, `svc-`, `lib-`). The repo is already the namespace;
  `Cargo.toml` and `docker ps` show the plain name. The non-attestation services (`notifications`,
  `turn`, `invites`) are *not* device attestation — don't imply otherwise.
- Lowercase kebab-case, short, greppable. Boring is good.
- **No themed/metaphorical names** (no `mint`/`citadel`/`signet`/nautical/etc.) and **no invented
  `-ity` brands** (the `-ity` policy is public-facing only and exempts crate/CLI names; also avoids
  colliding with Trinity/Levity/Nominality/…).

## Naming vocabulary

This is the **agreed vocabulary** for parts as they come to exist — **not** a list of folders to
create now. See "How the workspace grows" below.

### Shared library crates (product-agnostic, imported by services)

| Concept | Name | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| generated People Chain (subxt) typed surface | `chain-types` | crate; consumed by device-attestation, username-indexer, invite-tickets |
| chain connection / RPC transport + writer signing key | `chain-client` | crate (reconnecting connect + `WriterSigner` + `proxy_target`) |
| Postgres connection + bootstrap | `postgres` | still a module inside device-attestation / username-indexer |
| config loading + fail-fast validation | `config` | still a module per service |
| telemetry (logs / metrics / tracing) | `telemetry` | `http-common` (`telemetry::init` installs the log subscriber, `metrics::spawn` the Prometheus exporter); every process calls both. Logs go to stdout only — labelling, shipping, storage, and retention belong to the host's monitoring project, not to a service |
| JWT issuance + JWKS verification | `jwt-verify` | crate; the cross-service auth contract. Holds both the issuer and the verifier, but constructing the issuer needs the signing key, which only `device-attestation` is given — so the sole-issuer property is a deployment boundary, not a code one. device-attestation delegates its own signing and verification here; invite-tickets, turn, notifications, and username-indexer (for the proof-of-compute bypass) build verifiers only |
| the shared JSON error envelope + axum scaffolding (`{error}` / `fields`, JWT extractor, rate limiter, health, middleware stack, env helpers) | `http-common` | crate; consumed by invite-tickets, turn, notifications |

### Deployable services (plain domain word)

| Service | Responsibility | Processes |
|---|---|---|
| `device-attestation` | Device **attestation** + auth handshake + **sole JWT issuer** + username **write** path + **eligibility/queue** + reservation **outbox**. | `device-attestation-api` (N replicas) + `device-attestation-chain-writer` (single-instance outbox→chain worker) + `registration-queue` (single-instance queue advancer; with `QUEUE_ENABLED` on its promotion is the only queue exit — down, claims park as `QUEUED` behind the free lane's throttle and the writer raises the stranded-queue warning) |
| `username-indexer` | Username **indexer + public reads** (finalized state, plus the unfinalized window indexed speculatively on top of it): prefix search (`GET /api/v1/usernames/search`, paginated, per-IP rate limited) plus the optional proof-of-compute gate and its `POST /api/v1/poc/issue` puzzle issuance. The single-username lookup (`GET /api/v1/usernames/{username}`) is retired in favour of `search` and serves the JSON 404, like the removed list endpoint. Read-only projection; can be down without affecting registration. | `username-indexer` (+ own Postgres) |
| `notifications` | Thin `/api/v1/notify` relay. Verify-only Ed25519 JWT, stateless, DB-free, per-subject rate limited. No `depends_on`. iOS APNs (token auth, HTTP/2) + Android FCM (v1, OAuth2) providers, each optional. `APNS_ENVIRONMENT` picks the APNs host tried first; a `BadDeviceToken` rejection is retried once against the sibling host, so one relay serves both production and sandbox device tokens. | `notify-relay` |
| `turn` | Stateless TURN credential issuer over a selectable provider (`TURN_PROVIDER`), which is the one axis on which this service's behaviour genuinely differs. **`cloudflare`** (default): Cloudflare Realtime TURN mints both halves and returns the ICE server list with them, so there is no shared secret and nothing computed locally; one credential is fetched per request, the last good response is cached and served if Cloudflare is unreachable, after three consecutive failures the client serves that cache directly for 30s rather than making every caller wait out a timeout, and with nothing cached issuance is a 503. The cache covers *transient* failure only: a 4xx that is not 408 or 429 is Cloudflare saying this request will never succeed as configured — a revoked, wrong or mis-scoped token — so it is a 503 on the first request rather than a stale credential served to everyone at `warn` until the cache runs out and the breaker stops making the calls that would surface it. A cached credential is served only while a floor of its life remains, and that floor is derived from `TURN_TTL_SECS` (a minute, but never more than a quarter of the TTL) so a short TTL narrows the window rather than silently emptying the cache. **`coturn`**: a relay the operator runs in `--use-auth-secret` mode, where this service computes the credential itself (username = expiry:id, password = HMAC over the username under the relay-shared secret) and echoes the configured `ICE_SERVERS`, which is required on this provider and must name at least one relay — nothing upstream supplies it here, so an empty list would mint credentials with nothing to use them against; it reaches no network, so it cannot be unavailable and never returns that 503. Only the selected provider's configuration is read, so a deployment holds one provider's secret and not the other's, and a `TURN_SECRET` present while the provider is `cloudflare` is refused at boot rather than ignored — an existing relay deployment cannot silently land on the wrong provider. Two authorization paths: JWT-gated `POST /api/v1/turn/issue`, and — behind `TURN_PROOF_ENABLED` — proof-authorized `POST /api/v1/turn/issue-with-proof`, where a device proven under devicehood or a person redeems a ring-VRF membership proof instead of presenting a JWT. Redemption is a single request with no challenge round trip: the client supplies a timestamp, the server derives the proved message itself as `blake2b256(label ‖ timestamp)` and accepts it only inside a bounded clock skew, so nothing about the request is minted or stored. There is deliberately no client-chosen nonce and no genesis in the digest: the product builds this message and only needs a clock; chain identity is the ring root the server verifies against. Ring-VRF proofs are deterministic, so a person's proof for one second is one fixed value. The request repeats the collection id from TrUAPI's `ringLocation`; the server accepts only the canonical `pop:polkadot.network/people-lite` and `pop:polkadot.network/people` ids, selects that collection's independently refreshed root cache, and never falls through to the other. Required `ringIndex` and `ringRevision` name the single server-held root verification runs against, so every request costs at most one ring verification and a pair the server no longer holds is refused before admission. Proof bytes are the host's raw ring-VRF signature, with no SCALE length prefix. Each request names the `productId` it proves for, and the server verifies under the context it derives itself for that product (`blake2b256("product/" ‖ productId ‖ "/" ‖ indexBytes(suffix))`, the derivation the hosts use); an unlisted product is refused before verification. One context per product rather than one shared context is what keeps hosts from prompting the user — they prompt only when the proof context is not the calling product's own — at the cost of a per-person budget that is also per product. Requests never read the chain, verification concurrency defaults to available CPUs minus one (floor one), up to 64 saturated requests wait 50ms before returning 503, and a dead RPC never blocks boot or `/turn/issue`. The contextual alias recovered from a proof remains private under both providers, by different means. On `cloudflare` it ends at the throttle: it is an in-memory rate-limit key and nothing else, because Cloudflare mints the username and no part of the response is derived from the prover. On `coturn` there is no external minter, so the alias is additionally an input to a domain-separated, `TURN_SECRET`-keyed HMAC yielding one opaque 16-byte credential id per person and product — recoverable by nobody without the secret, and 16 bytes rather than the JWT route's 8 random ones so the two routes' credentials are indistinguishable by shape. Neither provider puts the alias itself in a response, a log, or a metric. The response reports the life remaining on the credential: the configured `TURN_TTL_SECS` on `coturn`, which mints to order, and on `cloudflare` the TTL Cloudflare granted except when a cached credential is served during an outage, when it is whatever that one has left. Serving cache is the one window in which callers share a username; it is logged at `warn` on every request for that reason. Both routes admit against their rate limit before issuing, and hand the slot back if issuance then fails upstream: an outage is not the caller's doing, and on the proof route the budget is per person and per product while a ring-VRF proof for a given second is one fixed value, so charging a 503 to it would lock a person out of a route that gave them nothing. `/turn/issue-with-proof` is the browser-callable route: `OPTIONS` answers the preflight (echoing the requested headers) and every response the route produces carries `access-control-allow-origin: *`. It is not origin-authorized — the proof is the authorization — so the wildcard gives a browser only what a non-browser client already had. `/turn/issue` carries no CORS headers; it is a JWT route called by the apps. No DB; N replicas need no coordination for credentials (rate limits, credential caches and root caches remain per replica, so on `cloudflare` each fetches its own credentials and rides out an outage independently, and on `coturn` each computes from the same shared secret). Each environment runs its own process because one process pins exactly one People Chain RPC and genesis for its root cache. | `turn-api` |
| `invite-tickets` | JWT-gated `POST /api/v1/invitation-ticket/claim` — synchronous invitation-credential claims from a pre-staged, on-chain-registered sr25519 keypair pool (its own Postgres). This is the route the shipping apps call for Game / ProofOfInk DIM claims. | `invite-tickets-api` (N replicas, DB-only, no signing secret) + `invite-tickets-pool` (single-instance keypair generator + on-chain registrar) |
| `gateway` (edge) | Public-URL routing via **Caddy**, one site block per environment. The route table is the committed `gateway/Caddyfile`: the `(routes)` snippet is imported once per environment with that environment's upstreams — username GET reads + `/api/v1/poc*` → its `username-indexer`, invitation tickets → its `invite-tickets-api`, TURN → its chain-pinned `turn-api`, notify → the shared `notify-relay`, everything else (attestation-owned writes/availability/root preflight, JWKS, health) → its `device-attestation-api`. Upstreams are container aliases suffixed with `ENV_ID` (`device-attestation-api-paseo-next-v2`), resolved over the shared external `dub-edge` network; an environment that does not run a service points that route at its own `device-attestation-api` so it 404s. Only notify is shared and verifies every environment's tokens from a merged JWKS. This is the **only** container publishing host ports (80/443, plus 443/udp); holds no secrets (both enforced by the compose boundary script). | `caddy` in its own compose project (`-p edge`) |


## How the workspace grows (lazy extraction)

The vocabulary above is **not** "make 11 folders." Folders appear incrementally:

- The crate list as it stands today is in `AGENTS.md` → Workspace.
- **Services** become crates **when you build them** — a service gets a folder the day work
  starts, not before.
- **Shared libs are extracted lazily — only when a *second* service needs the code.** Until then
  the logic lives as **modules inside** the owning service (today: `device-attestation/src/{config,db,chain}.rs`).
  `jwt-verify` was the first such extraction — pulled out the day `notifications` became the second
  verify consumer. Don't create a shared crate speculatively.
- **When you do extract, prefer a *few focused* crates, not extremes:**
  - ❌ 6 tiny crates scaffolded up front (premature boundaries, churn).
  - ❌ one `common`/`shared` grab-bag (every service recompiles + pulls everything).
  - ✅ a handful (realistically **3–4** over time) that each do one clear thing. `chain-types`,
    `jwt-verify` (the cross-service auth contract), and `chain-client` (reconnecting transport +
    writer signing key) are shared today; next candidate is optionally a small `platform` grouping
    of `config`+`telemetry`(+`postgres`) **only if** they always travel together.

## Classification quick-reference

- **attestation** → inside `device-attestation` (NOT a service, NOT a shared lib).
- **availability** → `device-attestation` (People Chain plus durable reservation-outbox read).
- **username write** → `device-attestation`.
- **username read/search** → `username-indexer` — true carve-out.
- **proof of compute** → `username-indexer` (the gate protects its public read; issuance lives with it).
- **free-reg eligibility/queue** → `device-attestation` product logic.
- **chain-writer** → worker (`device-attestation-chain-writer`) *inside* the `device-attestation` boundary.
- **notifications / turn / invites** → independent thin services, each outside the device-attestation
  boundary.
- **DIM tickets (game/personhood)** → game/personhood **claims** go through
  `/api/v1/invitation-ticket/claim`, which is the `invite-tickets` service. There is deliberately no
  separate request/status pair: the claim is synchronous.
- **gateway** → Caddy path routing (infra).

### Guardrails — do NOT create these as separate crates/services

`attestation`, `availability`, `eligibility`, `queue`, `writer` all live **inside**
`device-attestation`. Splitting any out contradicts the design (single device-attestation failure/secret boundary).

## Design decisions left open

Two things are deliberately not fixed by this design, because the right answer depends on the
deployment:

1. **Database topology.** "No shared tables" is decided; whether the three logical databases are
   separate instances, separate databases on one instance, or separate schemas is not. The compose
   file here runs three Postgres containers, which is the shape that makes the boundaries hardest
   to violate by accident, and the most expensive to operate. A single instance with three databases
   preserves every invariant the code relies on.
2. **Where the attester authority lives.** The design assumes the writer signs as a delay-0 `Any`
   proxy of a cold authority account, so the hot key can be rotated without touching the identity
   the clients pin. Nothing enforces that: a deployment may sign as the authority directly, and
   accept that rotating the key changes what `GET /api/v1/attester` returns.

## Deployment topologies

The system runs in one of **two** shapes. They serve an identical public API — a client cannot tell
them apart — and differ only in how many processes hold how many secrets.

### Standard: eight workloads (the default)

> Counts here are a `testnet` build. A `polkadot` build has no invite-tickets,
> so it runs six workloads and two singleton workers; everything else is
> identical. See [Choosing a network](operations.md#choosing-a-network).

Five HTTP services and three single-instance workers, each its own process with its own environment.
This is what the committed `docker-compose.yml` runs, and it is the recommended shape.

Its defining property is **secret compartmentalisation**, enforced rather than intended:
`device-attestation-api` is the one process holding `JWT_ED25519_SECRET`, so it is the one process that can
mint a token; the other four hold only `JWT_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY` and can verify. `POC_HMAC_SECRET`
reaches `username-indexer` and nothing else. The inviter signing key lives only on
`invite-tickets-pool`. Each of the three databases is reachable by only the services that own it.
`scripts/verify_compose_boundaries.sh` asserts every one of those against the rendered compose
configuration, and a change that widens them fails CI. A deployment that renders these workloads
some other way is responsible for reproducing the same boundaries — they are the design, not an
artifact of Compose.

### Small: four workloads (`--role all-in-one` + the three workers)

One process serves all five HTTP surfaces on one port, with the route table compiled in; the three
single-instance workers stay separate, because each owns a Postgres lease and a nonce lane and can
never be collapsed into anything.

This exists for deployments where operating eight workloads is not worth it. **It is a deliberate
trade, not a simplification**, and the thing being traded is the compartmentalisation above.

#### What the small topology gives up

In `all-in-one`, a single process holds, simultaneously:

| secret | what it grants |
|---|---|
| `JWT_ED25519_SECRET` | mint an access token for **any** subject |
| `POC_HMAC_SECRET` | forge proof-of-compute solutions, defeating the anti-scraping gate |
| three `*_DATABASE_URL`s | full read/write on device attestation, the username projection, and the ticket pool |
| `TURN_API_TOKEN` or `TURN_SECRET` | mint TURN credentials — on the org's Cloudflare account, billed to it, or against the operator's own relay |

and it reaches them from the same address space that serves `GET /api/v1/usernames/search` — an
**unauthenticated, public, internet-facing** endpoint.

So the difference is concrete: a memory-disclosure or RCE bug reachable from the search path reaches
a read-only username projection and a verify-only public key in the eight-workload topology, and
reaches token minting for the entire system in the small one. Nothing else about the two topologies
differs in this respect — same code, same handlers, same dependencies. The boundary is the process.

Secondary consequences, all of which follow from one process rather than five:

- **Blast radius.** Five surfaces share one Tokio runtime, one `standard_layers` timeout, and three
  connection-pool budgets. `standard_layers` has a timeout but no bulkhead, so a saturated search
  path and the auth handshake compete for the same resources.
- **Boot coupling.** Three migration sets run against three databases before anything serves, and
  `device-attestation-api`'s blocking People Chain connect gates the whole API — so with no reachable RPC
  there is no TURN, no notifications and no ticket claims either, where today there would be.
- **Deploy coupling.** Every deploy of any surface restarts all of them.

#### The rules that make it reviewable

- **Topologies are mutually exclusive.** A deployment runs eight per-service workloads *or*
  `all-in-one` plus the three workers — never a mix, which would pay the cost of the union while
  still running the compartmentalised services.
- **It cannot be reached by accident.** `all-in-one` is accepted by `--role` but is deliberately
  **absent from `dub --list-roles`**, so `scripts/verify_role_split.sh` rejects it in any manifest
  that claims to be the standard topology. Selecting it has to be a decision someone writes down.
- **The union is written out by hand.** Whatever mechanism a deployment uses to grant `all-in-one`
  its secrets should enumerate them rather than compute them, so the list growing is a visible diff
  in review.
- **Nothing is relaxed for the standard topology.** Every per-service boundary assertion still
  holds; the small topology adds rules rather than loosening any.

#### Readiness in the small topology

`all-in-one`'s `/readyz` is **degraded-but-ready**: it reports every component, and answers `200`
with `"status": "degraded"` while some are down, rather than `503`.

That is the opposite of the per-service behaviour, and deliberately so. Readiness controls whether
the instance receives traffic at all. With five surfaces behind one probe, a strict aggregate would
convert *"the ticket service's database is down"* into *"the whole API is out of rotation, auth
included"* — turning a partial outage into a total one, and with a single workload there is no
healthy replica for the traffic to move to, so nothing is gained by refusing it. A surface whose
dependency is down fails its own requests; that is where the failure belongs.

`/livez` remains a liveness echo in both topologies: dependency outages must never restart a
process, or a database blip becomes a crash loop.

## Implementation notes (data flow & invariants)

Operational invariants an agent must respect when touching the code.

- **Registration is an outbox.** `POST /api/v1/usernames` inserts a `RESERVED` row in
  `username_reservations` and returns `202`; `device-attestation-chain-writer` claims rows and submits the
  People Chain calls (`PeopleLite.attest` / `Resources.register_lite_person`), advancing
  `RESERVED → SUBMITTING → ASSIGNED | RETRY_AFTER | FAILED_TERMINAL`. The DB row is source of truth;
  chain is reconciled to it. No service reads another service's tables.
- **A claim's optional full-name reservation is checked before it is accepted, because it cannot be
  dropped afterwards.** `dotns.reservedUsername` is relayed into `attest`'s `reserved_username` — the
  bare, undiscriminated *personhood* name. It is **its own name**: `attest` takes it as a separate
  argument from the lite username, and nothing requires it to be that username's base, so the
  preflight reads the reservation state of the reserved name — not of the base being claimed under —
  and only skips the extra read when the two are equal. The runtime validates that leg **before** it
  writes the lite username, so a name already owned (`Resources::UsernameReservationTaken`), a
  reservation queue at `Resources::MaxReservationQueueLength` (`QueueFull`), or an account that
  already reserved (`AlreadyHasReservation`) costs the caller the **whole** registration, not just
  the reservation.
  The writer cannot resubmit without the reservation: the consumer signature covers
  `reserved_username`, so only the client can re-sign. Intake therefore refuses such a claim with a
  `409` before a row or a fee exists, and the writer treats all three as deterministic rejections so
  anything that races the check costs one fee rather than `CHAIN_WRITER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
- **Availability answers for the whole claim, not just the discriminators.** `EXHAUSTED` means
  nothing claimable under this base — no free discriminator (the offered pool is `01..=99`; `00` is
  never allocated), **or** a reservation leg that would reject the claim. Both the bare-name owner
  and the queue length are read in the same batched `state_queryStorageAt` as the 100 discriminator
  keys, so they cost no extra round trip and cannot disagree about their block.
  *Trade-off:* `base.NN` is genuinely claimable by a caller that sends no `dotns.reservedUsername`,
  and reporting `EXHAUSTED` withholds it. That costs nothing in practice: every client reserves
  unconditionally and no client is planned that can register without the reservation leg, so the
  withheld case has no caller. Making the last two conditions contingent on the caller's declared
  intent would only pay off if that changed.
- **The writer submits a whole pass as one extrinsic.** A claimed set becomes one
  `Utility.force_batch` of `attest` calls (proxied as a whole when the signer is a delegate), so N
  registrations cost one finalization rather than N. `force_batch`, never `batch_all`: one poison row
  must not block its batch. Each row's fate comes from its own `Utility.ItemCompleted` / `ItemFailed`
  **positionally**, and only when the item count matches the calls submitted — otherwise the
  positional mapping is discarded entirely and a batched `UsernameOwnerOf` read decides. A single-row
  set skips the wrapper and submits a bare `attest`. `ASSIGNED` is never inferred from an extrinsic
  succeeding, and never from `ProxyExecuted` being `Ok` around a `force_batch` (it is `Ok` even when
  every item failed).
- **A whole-batch failure is nobody's row's fault.** Nonce, signing, transport, or a proxy rejection
  of the batch itself re-queues the set as `RETRY_AFTER` at an **unchanged** `attempt`, on one shared
  backoff. Only per-item failures spend a row's attempt budget. Without this, eight flapping-RPC
  passes would send a whole claimed set to `FAILED_TERMINAL` for a fault no row caused.
- **The batch-size ceiling is a maximum, not a fixed claim size, and each lane has its own.** Each lane holds an adaptive
  size (AIMD, `chain_client::settle_batch_size`): halved on a whole-batch failure (floor 1), grown by
  one per successful submission, capped at the configured value and at one below the smallest size
  known to have failed — the lane re-probes that size only after a long clean run, so a chain that
  rejects every batch of two or more converges on 1 instead of alternating forever. The two lanes size independently,
  from separate ceilings — `CHAIN_WRITER_BATCH_SIZE` (People) and `CHAIN_WRITER_DOTNS_BATCH_SIZE` (dotNS) — because
  Asset Hub's weight budget and `reserve_name`'s cost are unrelated to People's: `reserve_name` dispatches through the
  DotNS contract on `pallet_revive` and declares enough weight that a handful of them in one `force_batch` exceeds what
  fits in a block, so the dotNS ceiling defaults an order of magnitude lower. Published as
  `dub_chain_batch_size{lane}`.
- **The registration queue is an outbox entry state, not a second pipeline.** With
  `QUEUE_ENABLED` (default off), `POST /api/v1/usernames` inserts claims as `QUEUED` rows with a
  `queue_group` (1–4) derived from the JWT subject's People Chain free balance (<10 DOT → 1,
  ≥10 → 2, ≥100 → 3, ≥1000 → 4; fail-open to 1). The advancer — the standalone single-instance
  `registration-queue` service — refreshes groups from chain and promotes up to 4 rows to
  `RESERVED` per iteration (`QUEUE_ADVANCE_INTERVAL_SECS`): slot k serves groups ≥ 5−k,
  earliest-enqueued wins, empty slots are skipped. Promotion is the only `QUEUED` exit; the
  writer path is unchanged from `RESERVED` on. `GET /api/v1/registration/queue` (JWT) reports
  position/group/ETA by simulating that drain over the current snapshot; the claim response
  gains additive `registrationOutcome: "QUEUED"` + `queue` fields (the queue-disabled wire is
  untouched).
- **A down queue service parks claims; it never unthrottles them.** The queue is the free
  lane's throughput control, so `QUEUE_ENABLED` alone is the policy: while it is on, every
  free-lane claim inserts as `QUEUED` and advancer promotion is the only queue exit. The
  `registration-queue` advancer holds a `writer_lease` row (`registration-queue-advancer`)
  that doubles as its liveness signal and single-instance guard — but liveness only affects
  *progress*: a dead (or never-deployed) advancer leaves claims parked durably behind the
  throttle, drained in fair slot order when it restarts, and the `device-attestation-chain-writer`
  raises a stranded-queue warning (paced by `QUEUE_FALLBACK_AFTER_SECS`) as the operator
  signal. With `QUEUE_ENABLED` **off**, the writer is the janitor: once the advancer lease
  has been expired longer than `QUEUE_FALLBACK_AFTER_SECS` (default 60) it drains leftover
  `QUEUED` rows to `RESERVED` itself (an **absent** lease row drains immediately — with the
  queue disabled nothing else would ever promote them), so retiring the queue strands
  nothing. `lease::renew` refuses an already-expired lease, so a stalled-then-recovered
  advancer re-acquires a fresh epoch instead of silently resurrecting a lease the janitor
  may have acted on; during long iterations the advancer renews concurrently with the work.
  `device-attestation-api` and `device-attestation-chain-writer` read the **same** `QUEUE_ENABLED` value and
  must never be deployed split: a mismatch either strands rows (writer on, api off) or
  drains a queue the api is still filling (writer off, api on).
- **Flipping `QUEUE_ENABLED` off is safe with rows still queued, but degrades visibility.**
  The flag gates only intake and the status route's mounting (`/api/v1/registration/queue`
  unmounts → plain-text 404; clients are documented to treat any 404 as "no longer queued,
  registration proceeding"). Promotion never consults the flag: a live advancer keeps draining
  queued rows, and a stopped one hands off to the writer's janitor drain (which runs only
  while the writer's own flag is off) — so nothing strands, but users mid-queue lose their
  standing display (and a rolling flag flip serves mixed answers across replicas). Preferred
  sequence when retiring the queue: flag off everywhere, writer last (intake stops first),
  let the advancer drain the remainder, then stop the advancer. Known
  API-shape limitation: an account with several queued claims sees only the earliest one's
  standing (the spec's response is a single object).
- **Registration is authorized by `candidateSignature`, not the JWT subject.** `POST
  /api/v1/usernames` verifies the beneficiary's sr25519 signature over `pop:people-lite:register
  using || candidatePubkey || ringVrfKey` (the message the chain reconstructs for `PeopleLite.attest`;
  Substrate signing context) before enqueuing. The JWT authenticates only the device/session — a
  separate per-install auth wallet — so `candidateAccountId` is deliberately **not** required to
  equal the JWT subject. Stored `account_id` (JWT subject) is the abuse-control/rate-limit key;
  `candidate_account_id` is the on-chain beneficiary the writer submits for.
- **`device-attestation-chain-writer` is single-instance by design** — a nonce lane is **(signing account,
  chain)**, and one process holds one lane per chain. The `writer_lease` table is a best-effort
  deploy-overlap guard only; the chain nonce + outbox reconciliation is the real serializer.
  Never run two writers / never scale it. The writer owns **two** lanes on one account, People
  and Asset Hub. That is safe because nonces are per chain. Both sit behind the same single
  lease, so one lease still means one submitter on each.
- **The dotNS gateway lane is a second state machine on the same row.** Usernames
  live in two independent stores with no bridge between them. People
  `Resources::UsernameOwnerOf` is written by `PeopleLite.attest`. The Asset Hub dotNS contracts
  are written **only** by `DotnsGateway::reserve_name`. There is no bridge between them.
  A row therefore carries `status` (People) and `dotns_status` (Asset Hub). The two advance
  independently through `PENDING → SUBMITTING → RESERVED | RETRY_AFTER | FAILED_TERMINAL |
  EXPIRED`. **A dotNS failure never changes `status`.** `ASSIGNED` + `DOTNS_FAILED_TERMINAL` is a
  legitimate resting state: the username works, the dotNS name does not. The dependency runs one
  way only: a People `FAILED_TERMINAL` closes an open dotNS half as `ABANDONED`, since a name with
  no username behind it can never be submitted. Ordering is not free.
  `reserve_name` writes `LiteLabelOwner`, a global claim on the label. Asset Hub is therefore
  attempted **only** for rows already `ASSIGNED` on People. `dotns_status` `NULL` means the
  request carried no `dotns` block *or* the row predates the lane. There is no backfill, so
  pre-existing rows are never submitted.
- **The gateway lane's freshness bounds come from the chain, not from config.** `reserve_name`
  enforces `MaxValiditySeconds`/`MaxFutureSkewSeconds` against the client's `signedAt`, and the
  writer enforces **both** before spending an extrinsic — device-attestation-api's
  `DOTNS_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_SECS` is a separate value on a separate process and cannot be the only
  guard. The backend **cannot re-sign**; only the client holds the candidate key. An aged-out row
  is `EXPIRED`: terminal, never retried. A future-dated one is *deferred* behind
  `dotns_not_before` without spending an attempt — the clock resolves it, so failing it would kill
  a row that was always going to succeed. **A signer that cannot pay is deferred on the same
  reasoning**: `Inability to pay some fees` is rejected at validation, so it enters no block, spends
  no fee and says nothing about the row. It *parks* — re-queued at an unchanged attempt, never
  counted toward `CHAIN_WRITER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, never terminal however long the outage runs. The
  budget exists to stop a bad row retrying forever; a funding gap is not a bad row, and burning
  eight attempts in three minutes against a three-day signature would discard a claim only the
  client can re-sign. The mirror of that rule is the other direction: a rejection that cannot come
  out differently for the same call (`DETERMINISTIC_REJECTIONS`) is terminal on the *first* pass
  rather than paying its fee eight times over.
- **A dotNS problem parks the dotNS lane; it never stops the writer.** Only one dotNS condition is
  a startup abort: a missing `ASSET_HUB_RPC_URL`, a config error knowable
  before any row is claimed. Everything else is runtime. Asset Hub is connected lazily on the
  first pass, not at boot, so an unreachable endpoint — an RPC bounce, a DNS blip, maintenance —
  leaves rows in `PENDING` and keeps People attesting, instead of crash-looping the process. The
  `DotnsGateway::reserve_name` shape assertion sits on that same path. Both target Asset Hubs
  currently expose the supported `signed_at` shape, but a runtime upgrade can change it at any
  time, so it is asserted per connect and parks the lane rather than the writer.
  `dub_dotns_lane_connected` is the signal.
- **Signing:** one canonical `ATTESTER_ACCOUNT` (SS58) names the attester authority, and **proxying
  is derived, not configured**: the writer signs `PeopleLite.attest` directly when that account is
  its own signer, and wraps it in `Proxy.proxy(real = authority, …)` otherwise. A proxied call's
  real outcome is `Proxy.ProxyExecuted`, not the extrinsic's — the outer extrinsic succeeds even
  when the inner call is rejected — so the writer inspects `ProxyExecuted` before advancing a row to
  `ASSIGNED`, recording any rejection as `Pallet::Variant` — resolved through subxt's own
  `DispatchError`, against the metadata of the block the extrinsic landed in, by one implementation
  shared with the Asset Hub lane. `ASSIGNED` therefore always means the registration is on chain.
  Under batching the `ProxyExecuted` check narrows to a whole-batch gate: it reports the outer
  `force_batch`, which succeeds even when every item in it failed, so the per-row verdict comes from
  the item events instead.
- **device-attestation-api and device-attestation-chain-writer read the same `ATTESTER_ACCOUNT`.** Clients fetch
  `GET /api/v1/attester` and bind their consumer-registration signature to it, so the published key
  and the attesting account are one value by construction and cannot drift into
  `PeopleLite::InvalidAttestationSignature`. The API derives the `0x`+hex wire form; nothing
  configures it separately. Both pallets see that same account as the attester — under
  `Proxy.proxy(real = P)`, `P` is what `GET /api/v1/attester` returns, on People and Asset Hub
  alike.
- **The target runtime is a build input.** `DUB_NETWORK` (`testnet` — the default, paseo-next-v2 —
  or `polkadot`) is read by
  `crates/chain-types/build.rs`, which every crate that compiles differently per network shares. It
  picks the vendored blob the People types are generated from, and it decides whether invite-tickets
  exists: the `polkadot` runtime has no `Game` or
  `ProofOfInk`, so there the crate compiles to nothing and `dub` has no invite-tickets roles. The
  signing path, the transaction-extension tuples and the edge route table are the same on every
  network (the tuples are the union of every known runtime's extensions).
- **`chain-types` is the only place chain types live.** Static codegen from vendored metadata at
  `crates/chain-types/metadata/metadata.<network>.scale`; online transport + signing live in
  `device-attestation::chain`, never in `chain-types`. Regenerate with the `subxt metadata …` command
  at the top of `crates/chain-types/src/lib.rs`. It holds one subxt config per chain family,
  `PeopleConfig` and `AssetHubConfig`. Their transaction-extension sets differ, and a merged
  tuple would exceed subxt's 26-member ceiling. **Only People is code-generated.** The Asset Hub
  surface is one extrinsic and two storage reads, built dynamically by name rather than by
  vendoring a second, faster-churning metadata blob.
- **HTTP** (`device-attestation::http`): router in `http.rs` wrapped in a tower-http stack
  (request-id → trace → 30s timeout) with graceful shutdown. Health at `/livez`, `/readyz` (gates on
  a live Postgres `SELECT 1`), `/healthcheck`; JWKS at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. `AppState` carries
  the Postgres pool, `ChainClient`, `Jwt` and `Config`, plus the rate limiter, the attestation CRL
  cache and the optional DeviceCheck / Play Integrity clients. `username-indexer` uses the same tower-http
  stack, but its `/readyz` also reports index freshness and it never publishes JWKS — it holds
  **verify-only** key material (`JWT_JWKS_JSON` / `JWT_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY`), and only when
  `POC_ENABLED=true`, so authenticated callers can bypass the proof-of-compute gate.
- **invite-tickets: the pool has two states and the claim is one transaction.** A ticket row is
  `available` (generated, registered on-chain) or `claimed` — nothing else; failed registrations
  are never inserted. The claim is: pre-check count (`0` → 422 `Pool exhausted`) → one transaction
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1` + flip to `claimed` (no row →
  409 `Ticket race lost`) → sign → post-claim count as `remaining`. The signature is sr25519 by the
  **ticket** key over the **decoded 32-byte account id** of `who` (substrate signing context), not
  the address string. Pools are keyed `(dim, network)`; FIFO by `created_at`. The api bin never
  touches the People Chain and holds no signing secret besides the pool rows it serves — chain
  RPC and the inviter secret belong only to the single-instance `invite-tickets-pool` bin.
  **`invite-tickets-pool` must not share a signing account with any other submitter** — two
  independent submitters on one account race nonces; give each its own inviter (e.g. separate
  proxy delegates of one cold primary). As for the attester, proxying is
  **derived, not configured**: `INVITER_ADDRESS` names the account holding the invites, and a
  signing key whose own account differs from it wraps the batch in
  `Proxy.proxy(real = INVITER_ADDRESS, force_proxy_type = Any)`.
- **`username-indexer` serializes projection writes on one Postgres advisory lock.** Bootstrap and
  the incremental sync loop share one lock id; a full snapshot bootstrap runs **only when there is no
  usable `sync_state` checkpoint**, and each sync pass takes the lock with `pg_try_advisory_lock`
  (skips the pass if another instance holds it). So the service is safe as N replicas on one shared
  Postgres, and restarts resume incrementally from the checkpoint (no full re-scan).
- **A checkpoint is usable only for the chain it was taken from.** `sync_state.genesis_hash` stamps
  which chain the block number belongs to; on boot, a mismatch against the connected chain means the
  whole projection restates storage that no longer exists, so the checkpoint and the rows are
  discarded together (one transaction) and a full bootstrap rebuilds them. This is automatic and
  unconditional because the projection is derived state — the alternative is an indexer that resumes
  on a position from a chain it shares no history with and serves the dead chain's usernames. A NULL
  stamp means the row predates the column and is adopted rather than rebuilt.
- **`username-indexer` public reads share one per-IP rate-limit bucket, and it is the outermost
  layer on the route.** It does no cryptography by design, so a caller that has exhausted its window
  cannot force JWT verification or puzzle hashing. The gateway forwards the GET surface to the
  indexer, while attestation-owned POST/OPTIONS traffic falls through to `device-attestation-api`.
- **The proof-of-compute gate is either-or, and off by default.** With `POC_ENABLED=false` (the
  shipping default) there is no `/api/v1/poc/issue` route and search behaves exactly as before. With
  it on, `GET /api/v1/usernames/search` admits a caller that presents **either** a valid
  device-attestation JWT **or** a solved puzzle: `POST /api/v1/poc/issue` returns an HMAC-signed
  `{sessionId, timestamp, difficulty, checksum}` (no row written — issuance is stateless), and the
  client returns `Proof-Of-Compute: base64(sessionId:timestamp:difficulty:counter:checksum)` where
  `sha256(sessionId || timestamp || counter)` has at least `difficulty` leading zero bits.
  Verification order is checksum → expiry → work → **one-shot consume** (`spent_puzzles`, a
  primary-key insert, so a puzzle cannot be replayed against another replica). A bearer token that fails verification degrades to *anonymous* and never yields a
  `401`: search must not become an authenticated route. Rejections are `400` for a malformed header
  and `402` for everything else, each naming its reason in `error`. Both shipping mobile apps
  authenticate search, so the gate costs them nothing; the anonymous callers are the Desktop/host
  path (and Android's `DISABLE_AUTH` nightly build).
- **`notifications` is an isolated failure domain.** It is stateless, DB-free, and shares no
  `depends_on` with any other service, so `/readyz` needs no external probe (readiness = the bound
  listener; provider outages are per-request `200 success:false`, never unreadiness) and stopping it
  or feeding it bad provider secrets can only fail `/api/v1/notify`. Its `/api/v1/notify` route is
  rate-limited **per authenticated subject** (JWT `accountId`) keyed on `route:subject` — never raw
  client IP — enforced after JWT verification, `429` with `Retry-After` and the shared
  `{error}` envelope on exceed (no machine code; that dialect is device-attestation's). It holds only the JWT
  **public** key (verify-only); push secrets (`APNS_*`/`FCM_*`) are service-owned.
