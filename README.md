A Rust backend that proves a device is a distinct physical device, and registers
a username for it on Polkadot's People Chain — plus the sibling services a
consumer app tends to need around that. It is a **reference blueprint**: fork it,
point it at whichever network you want, deploy it under whatever name you want.

## What it does

Eight services on a `testnet` build (six on `polkadot`, which has no
invite-tickets — see [Choosing a network](docs/operations.md#choosing-a-network)),
each of which owns its Postgres database where it has one, and
each of which deploys independently behind a single-URL
[gateway](gateway/Caddyfile):

- **`device-attestation-api`** — the auth handshake (challenge → hardware
  attestation → JWT + refresh), username registration gated on device uniqueness
  (`POST /api/v1/usernames`, availability, queue status), the
  attester key, JWKS, health. Verifies Apple App Attest and Android Play
  Integrity / key attestation.
- **`device-attestation-chain-writer`** — a single-instance worker that drains
  the reservation outbox onto the chain.
- **`registration-queue`** — a single-instance queue advancer; while
  `QUEUE_ENABLED` is on, it is the only path out of the registration queue.
- **`username-indexer`** — a username projection with public prefix search,
  plus an optional proof-of-compute gate on that search. Finalized state is
  authoritative; the unfinalized window is indexed speculatively on top of it so
  a new registration is searchable a finality trail sooner.
- **`invite-tickets-api`** / **`invite-tickets-pool`** — synchronous
  invitation-ticket claim, and the keypair pool that keeps it stocked.
- **`turn-api`** — a stateless TURN credential issuer (Cloudflare Realtime TURN, or a self-hosted coturn relay).
- **`notify-relay`** — a stateless APNs / FCM push relay.

Plus **`voucher-mint`**, an operator CLI for minting registration vouchers
(deliberately not an HTTP surface).

Registration can additionally claim a **dotNS** label on Asset Hub, as a second
independent state machine alongside the People Chain registration.

## What it does not do

- **It is not audited, and it is not a hardened production build.** See
  [Security](#security).
- **It does not run a chain.** It is a client of one, and it needs an attester
  account on that chain with an allowance and a funded signing proxy —
  prerequisites it cannot create for itself.
- **It does not issue personhood.** Device uniqueness is not proof of a person;
  it is one signal among several.
- **It does not ship a Kubernetes chart or any deployment automation.** Docker
  Compose is the configuration contract; port it wherever you like.

## One binary, every role

Every service and worker is a `--role` of the single `dub` binary. What makes a
container a given service is its role, not a different image:

```
dub --list-roles                       # eight on testnet, six on polkadot
dub --role device-attestation-api
dub --help                             # which network this binary was built for
```

## Quickstart

You need Docker with Buildx, and about ten minutes for the first compile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend-community.git
cd device-uniqueness-backend-community
cp .env.example .env

docker network create dub-edge dub-metrics   # once per host

# bake reads the shell, NOT .env: export this or you get a testnet image.
export DUB_NETWORK=testnet                   # or polkadot
docker buildx bake all                       # one cargo build, one image
docker compose up -d                         # nothing is published — the edge does that
```

Nothing binds a host port by default. To reach a service directly, layer the
loopback-only debug overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d
#   device-attestation 127.0.0.1:8080 · indexer :8081
#   turn :8084 · notify :8085 · invite-tickets :8083 (testnet builds only)

curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/readyz
```

Or run a single role natively: `just run` / `just run-writer` / `just run-notify`,
with environment from `.env.example`.

### The network you are starting from

Out of the box `.env.example` points at **Paseo Next v2**
(`wss://paseo-people-next-system-rpc.polkadot.io` and its Asset Hub), a public
test network that is wiped and re-spawned routinely, and uses the well-known
development keys `//Alice` and `//Bob`. That is enough for the stack to start
and for the read paths to work.

For anything past that you need, on whichever network you target:

- an **attester account** with an attestation allowance,
- a **funded signing key** authorized as that account's `Any`/delay-0 proxy,
- for invites, an inviter account holding `AvailableInvites` quota.

The binary is **built for one People runtime**: `DUB_NETWORK` is `testnet` (the
default — paseo-next-v2) or `polkadot` (polkadot-test). It picks
the vendored People metadata and, on `polkadot` — whose runtime has no `Game` /
`ProofOfInk` — leaves the invite-tickets services out. Set it in `.env` before
building, together with `COMPOSE_PROFILES` and the RPC endpoints; see
[Choosing a network](docs/operations.md#choosing-a-network).

If you repoint `PEOPLE_RPC_URL`, point `ASSET_HUB_RPC_URL` at an Asset Hub on
the same network running the `signed_at` `reserve_name` in the same edit. The
dotNS lane is not optional; where the shape does not match, the writer parks the
lane rather than submitting.

[docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md) covers this from zero, including the
secret boundaries the compose file enforces and why they are worth keeping.

A live reference deployment of this code runs at
<https://identity.dotspark.app> ([API reference](https://identity.dotspark.app/docs)).
It exists so the API is explorable without deploying anything. It is a test
deployment operated by Parity on a test network — do not build against it, and do
not expect it to be there.

## Develop

```bash
just check                 # fmt + clippy + workspace tests + the config gates
just test-live-db          # deterministic Postgres suites; also required by CI
just test-live-chain       # optional Postgres + live People Chain smokes
just test-live-providers    # optional credentialed APNs / FCM smokes
just coverage-db           # canonical offline + Postgres coverage report
just deny                  # dependency licence and advisory audit
just openapi               # regenerate docs/api-reference after route/DTO changes
just routes                # regenerate the gateway route table
```

`just openapi` and `just routes` produce **committed generated artifacts** — a
test in `just check` fails if either is stale. Never hand-edit them.

## Releases

**This repository publishes binaries.** Releases are cut manually from a
`vX.Y.Z` tag via the [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml). Each one
attaches:

Every asset is built twice, once per People runtime — `testnet` (paseo-next-v2)
and `polkadot` (polkadot-test) — because `DUB_NETWORK` is fixed
when the binary is built. Take the pair matching the chain you point at;
`dub --help` prints the network a binary was built for.

- `dub-<version>-<network>-<target>.tar.gz` — the single `dub` binary for
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`;
- `dub-compose-<version>-<network>.tar.gz` — `docker-compose.yml`,
  `.env.example` (already naming that network) and the gateway config, so the
  stack stands up on a host with no source tree;
- `SHA256SUMS`, covering every asset above.

**Verifying a tagged build.** Download `SHA256SUMS` alongside the assets and run
`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`. To satisfy yourself the binaries are this source,
build them yourself: `docker buildx bake all` compiles the very same
`Dockerfile` stage the release exports from.

### About the container image

There is a public image at `docker.io/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend`, but
it is **not published from this repository** — Parity builds and pushes it from
its own working tree, and **its tags do not line up with this repository's
tags**. At the time of first publish it carries `v0.3.0`, built from source
older than this release. Treat it as a convenience, not as the artifact
corresponding to a tag here.

Because of that, the compose bundle does not blindly pin to it. The release
workflow checks whether an image exists at `<tag>-<network>` and is anonymously
pullable — one image per network, since an image carries a binary built for one
runtime; if it is, that network's bundle pins to it, and if it is not, the
bundle keeps its `build:` stanzas and the release notes say so. Either way the
bundle works — the second case just needs a source checkout beside it:

```bash
tar xzf dub-compose-<version>-<network>.tar.gz && cp .env.example .env
docker network create dub-edge dub-metrics

# only if the bundle was not pinned to an image. bake reads the shell, not
# .env, so name the same network the bundle is for:
export DUB_NETWORK=<network>
docker buildx bake all
docker compose up -d
```

Changes per release: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). **Pre-1.0, breaking changes
bump the minor** — `0.4.x` → `0.5.0` can break you.

## Security

Before deploying it for real use cases, you are responsible for:

- Reviewing the code yourself — we publish a reference, not a hardened
  production build
- Checking that the dependencies are up to date and free of known
  vulnerabilities
- Securing your own fork or deployment environment (keys, secrets, network
  configuration)
- Tracking the latest tagged release and commits for security fixes; older
  releases are not backported (exceptions might apply)

This code has **not been audited**. The defaults in `.env.example` are
development defaults — well-known dev keys, a public test network, permissive
toggles — and every one of them must be replaced before a deployment anyone else
can reach.
