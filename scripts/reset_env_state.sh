# Reset an environment's chain-derived database state after the chain it points
# at has been wiped (the test networks are re-spawned routinely) or repointed.
#
# Scope, and why it is not "drop everything":
#
#   deleted  username_reservations  the registration outbox. ASSIGNED rows name
#                                   usernames no chain will confirm, and every
#                                   row — whatever its status — permanently
#                                   occupies a discriminator, because
#                                   `allocated_discriminators` unions the whole
#                                   table into availability with no status
#                                   filter. Left in place, a base with 100
#                                   historical rows reports EXHAUSTED against an
#                                   empty chain.
#   deleted  writer_lease           expires on its own, but clearing it lets the
#                                   restarted writer claim immediately instead of
#                                   waiting out a lease from before the reset.
#
#   KEPT     app_attest_keys        per-install Apple device keys. No chain
#                                   relationship at all; deleting them makes
#                                   every tester reinstall to re-attest.
#   KEPT     registration_vouchers  minted voucher hashes. The plaintext existed
#                                   exactly once, in the mint CLI's stdout, so a
#                                   delete cannot be undone — the vouchers would
#                                   have to be re-minted and redistributed.
#   KEPT     auth_challenges,       TTL'd. They expire faster than anyone can
#            refresh_tokens         act on this script.
#
# The username-indexer database is NOT touched by default: since the
# `genesis_hash` guard in `crates/username-indexer/src/bootstrap.rs`, the
# service detects a changed chain at boot and rebuilds its projection itself.
# `--include-indexer` forces that rebuild by hand, for when the guard is not yet
# deployed or the projection needs clearing for some other reason.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/reset_env_state.sh --project <name> --confirm <name> [--include-indexer] [--dry-run]
#
#   --project          compose project to act on (`dub-paseo-next-v2` for the
#                      primary stack).
#   --confirm          must repeat --project exactly. The whole guardrail: this
#                      command is destructive and several environments can run
#                      from the same compose file on one host, so naming the
#                      target twice is what stops a reset landing on the wrong
#                      stack.
#   --include-indexer  also clear the username-indexer projection + checkpoint.
#   --dry-run          report the row counts that would be deleted, delete
#                      nothing, and leave every service running.
#
# Run from the checkout whose compose file defines the target project.
